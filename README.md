Issues | User Stories | The title of each issue is a user story: it is a high-level feature description that helps the developer focus on the business value of the product
Milestones | Sprint | This represents a **fixed** length of time during which all developers and designers agree to produce a certain chunk of work.
Epics | Epics | They are big user-stories (higher-level, more abstract issues) which focus on the big picture 
Pipeline | | The columns in the Board (similar to Trello format), that shows the stages of each issue as it progresses through the development cycle
